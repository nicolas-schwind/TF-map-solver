# Team Formation

The Team Formation problem (TF) considers multiple individuals that match a required set of skills, and
consists in selecting a group of individuals that maximizes one or several social positive attributes.
The two directories correspond to two tools:

* map-generation-visualisation: an instance generator based on the facility location problem and a solution visualization, assuming some solutions for these instances have been computed. 
* solver: a solver of TF instances based on different solution concepts

The archive all-instances.zip contains all instances considered in the submitted paper. In this archive, the directories 5-map-r1, 6-map-r2, 7-map-r3, and 8-map-r4 contain instances generated with our tool.
